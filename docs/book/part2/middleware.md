# Create Album list middleware

We will now setup a new middleware to show the album list. We will not have any data to display just yet, but the exercise will demonstrate writing your first middleware.

Create a `AlbumList` request handler. We can use our tooling to create the file:

````bash
$ composer expressive handler:create "App\Handler\HelloHandler"
````
